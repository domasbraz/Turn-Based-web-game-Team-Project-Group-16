If you have download this file, it must mean you have downloaded the source code.

There is currently an issue with a html file, your antivirus will likely detect a false possitive, hence the releases cannot be downloaded until this issue is fixed.
We suspect this is an issue with Windows Defender as we did not encounter this issue before, but as of 10/04/2024 all releases are flagged for false possitives (you can still download the source code however).
This also means that there is a chance that after opening these files, that the antivirus will put one of the html files in quaranteen, if this happens, you will need to
go to your antivirus and restore the file if you wish to test it.

To play the game on your local machine, open "index.html" inside the "docs" folder.
